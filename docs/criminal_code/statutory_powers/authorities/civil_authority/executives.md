Executive Personnel are classified as those holding a Security Clearance of 4 or those designated as Installation Directors. These personnel, unless holding a position within a Prosecutory Authority, have the powers of temporary detainment. Executives may **not** incapacitate or pursue rogues and are to call for a more adept Civil Authority or Prosecutory Authority where possible. Furthermore, they may not respond to requests for a Civil Authority outside of Moderation Affairs and may not actively search for criminal activity.

Executives have this ability to detain as a privelege; Prosecutory or Legislative Authorities respective command staff may revoke specific individuals ability to do so at any time.
