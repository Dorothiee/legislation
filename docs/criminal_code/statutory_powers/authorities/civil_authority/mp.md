The Military Police is the central Civil Authority and esentially acts as the Prosecutory Authority's power within the Combative Sector of the Foundation. Military Police personnel are constabularized and capable of imposing basic access restrictions, detaining and arresting individuals. They are also tasked with maintaining the welfare and security of Class E personnel and their housing facilities, enforcing the Highway Code and operating both pedestrian and motor vehicle checkpoints.

Military Police Personnel may issue Traffic Citations however an Ethics Committee Prosecutor must sign off on them for them to be validated; see the appropriate article.
