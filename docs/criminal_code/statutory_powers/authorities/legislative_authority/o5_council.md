The O5 Council is the **Supreme Authority** within the Foundation and acts as the supreme court of law for all legal decision. Councillors and at their discretion Executive Assistants may chose to allow an appeal to be heard by the Council if the verdict reached by Overwatch Command or any other judicial authority is viewed as unrealistic, bias or poorly prescribed in relation to the offense.

A single O5 Councillor is capable of dictating the final verdict in any case however it is usually standard for a vote to be conveined on large legislative decisions, especially on thos pertaining to departmental dispute (such as fictional events like Medical Department v. Scientific Department) - cases between departments are typically heard by the entire Council immediately if oversight provides unsatisfactory result. 

Any decree delivered by the O5 Council is considered *Case Law* and must be logged within Criminal Code as a final decision for all future cases unless it is repealed by a different case or Executive Order after the fact. *The O5 Councils word is final and can only be repealled by The Administrator.*
