The Manufacturing Department is responsible for maintaining and creating a wide variety of assets that can be used by the Foundation to keep anomalies in containment and provide an overall enjoyable experience to our personnel. The Manufacturing Department is a sub-directory of the Administrative Department. Most of the work within the Manufacturing Department is kept confidential.

As part of recent transparency changes, the guidelines for MaD are now for the most part public.
