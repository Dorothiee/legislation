| Formatting has been completely redone into something unique of its own, colors are used, and it does not copy someone else's work. It does not copy questions from another person or reuses their own questions | The answers provided and the questions/tasks provided must be relevant to a checkup. Answers must be completely written in quotes, allowing for the grader to understand that was their answer. Questions must be relevant at all times. There must be detail in every aspect of the conclusion at the end of the checkup. The diagnostic and recommended treatment must be at least two sentences each and must be concise and descriptive. | The format itself is clearly marked with headings and is clear enough that it follows a pattern where it is readable. It also follows all formatting requirements. |
