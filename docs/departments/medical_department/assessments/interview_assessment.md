| Formatting has been completely redone into something unique of its own, colors are used, and it does not copy someone else's work. It does not copy questions from another person or reuses their own questions. | Questions do not deter from the topic on hand. Questions do not push towards a breach of the SCP. Questions are relevant. | The format itself is clearly marked with headings and is clear enough that it follows a pattern where it is readable. It also follows all formatting requirements. | The question and conclusion must be clearly descriptive and relevant to SCP-049. There must be some sort of objective given for the procedure to be valid. The conclusion must be at least a paragraph and explains the medical findings of what the Research Question was trying to solve. |
