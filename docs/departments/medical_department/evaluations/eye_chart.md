:::info
There has been a lot of confusion among the members here in the Medical Department at how to read the eye chart. The following scoring guidelines are to be followed below:
:::

- Completion of the 8th line is a 20/20 vision.
- Completion of the 7th line is a 20/25 vision.
- Completion of the 6th line is a 20/30 vision.
- Completion of the 5th line is a 20/40 vision.
- Completion of the 4th line is a 20/50 vision.
- Completion of the 3rd line is a 20/100 vision.
- Completion of the 2nd line is a 20/200 vision.
- Completion of the 1st line is a 20/500 vision.

:::caution
When they fail a line, you mark them for the previous line they completed. For example, if someone fails the 8th line they are 20/25 vision.
