title: Activity Expectations
sidebar_position: 9
---

As a Mobile Task Forces member, you are expected to uphold a decent amount of activity. There are no activity quotas, however it is generally expected by all command personnel that everyone gets on for at least 2 or 3 hours once a week. If you do go inactive without any prior warning, you will eventually be contacted by your task force command and asked to either file a Leave of Absence or you will be punished.

To file a Leave of Absence, go to the #inactivity_notices channel under the category of “General Utility” and use the format found [here](https://discord.com/channels/686654393592184963/708125233697128518/822806366484955148).

:::note
Please use inactivity notices reasonably and not just to stay in the department and sit inactivity for months. You will eventually be caught if you do attempt this, and will be reprimanded.
