After you’ve passed tryouts, you’re placed as a Field Cadet. You’ll be a Field Cadet for around 3 weeks, performing regular duties around the site, and expressing how active you are. At the end of these 3 weeks, you’ll be given a final exam, which will go over everything a regular MTF Agent needs to know, and will also include your preference for which task force you’d like to be placed in.

After all exams are graded, you will be placed in whatever task force is available. We will try our best to place Field Cadets into their preferred task force, however this isn’t always possible. You will always be able to transfer later down the line however, if you don’t like the task force you’re given.

Field Cadets will primarily patrol Omicron, and if Omicron is secure, patrol/guard Epsilon. If all sites are clear, you may go to Phi and guard and patrol. If there is absolutely nothing left to do, you may ping a Specialist+ to assist them in their duties.
