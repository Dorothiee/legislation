The Foundation's line of work requires a large number of highly specialized professionals. This is usually related to anomalies that require much effort and an unorthodox approach for containment. To address this, Mobile Task Forces are formed. MTFs are teams of varying sizes that specialize in specific roles or respond to specific situations. 

MTF works alongside the Security Department to ensure that the Installation remains under strict safety. The difference between these two very similar departments is that the Mobile Task Forces utilizes special weapons and tactics, divided into 3 task forces (Falcon 2, Crimson 9, and Rhino 8) in order to keep their sole duties separated.
