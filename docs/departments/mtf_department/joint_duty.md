:::info
The purpose of Joint Duty Apportion is to ensure that all personnel within MTF do not get burnt out quickly. Whilst they do have main duties that they will be doing for a majority of the time theyâ€™re on-site, when they do not have the ability to do their primary duties, they may guard other portions of the site in order to make sure that Agents have more to do than stand around in an area for too long. The following list will detail more exactly what each task force may do when their primary duties are unable to be fulfilled.
