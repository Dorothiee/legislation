:::info
As a Mobile Task Forces member, you are given a number of tools to better assist you in your specialized duties. However, due to specifics of some of these tools, there is a very high chance and open chance for them to be abused. Due to this, the command has agreed to come together and form strict regulations on them.
:::

<ol>
    <li>Firearms should only be discharged if you believe they are impeding in your duties. Falcon 2 have more specific termination guidelines, and Rhino 8 follows the Class D Termination Guidelines.</li>
    <li>Tasers should be utilized appropriately and not used or abused in any sort of unprofessional manner.</li>
    <li>Handcuffs should be utilized only for the purpose of detaining rogues, moving personnel who are impeding on your duties, or any other valid reasons you may have according to your task force guidelines.</li>
    <li>Shield combo at the moment has no limits, however avoid abusing it in too many cases to avoid mass complaints, especially during raids.</li>
    <li>Using any of your tools against a command member or a fellow MTF member is not allowed, unless they are abusing regulations.</li>
</ol>

:::caution
Breaking any of these regulations will result in harsh punishment and it is likely you will be suspended, or demoted, depending on how heavy the offense is, or if you are a repeat offender.
