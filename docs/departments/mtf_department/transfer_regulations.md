:::info
Task Force Members who wish to transfer are to abide by a minimum criterion before transferring. Transfers may have ranged reasons such as burnout, not fun, or something they didnâ€™t expect, which most members have a tendency to face. However, transferring can be abusable towards a degree, which is why there are strict regulations when transferring. 
:::

- Must hold one month of servitude for the current Task Force.
- Must not hold any negative records within the Task Force.
- Must receive approval from both involved Captains.
    - In the event of no captain, the Field Chief will handle it.
- A limit of one transfer from each task force is allowed in the timespan of 7 days.
    - If one R-8 would like to discharge, they would need to wait 7 days from the last R-8 transfer request to transfer properly. gtest

:::caution
If the transfer request is accepted, the transferred individual will have to leave all previous Task Force affiliates and begin from scratch as an Agent in the new Task Force. So site activity, trainings, and rank times will all be <strong>voided, no matter of rank.</strong> Personnel are able to transfer to a Task Force they were previously in if they re-attend a tryout given my Command.
