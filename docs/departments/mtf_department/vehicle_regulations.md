:::info
As a Mobile Task Forces Agent, you will be required to utilize vehicles as much as possible, especially during highway patrols. And due to this, we’ve implemented regulations that will moderate your driving.
:::

- You should not drive recklessly at all. Make slow turns, drive at a decent speed, and avoid crashing. If you do crash, move on with your drive, and try to avoid it next time.
- You should be following the Supreme Regulation’s speed limit at all times, however it may be bypassed when in an emergency situation.
- When you become a Field Cadet, you have an automatic license. Do not abuse this or else it will be suspended.

:::note
All vehicles may be used by MTF personnel whenever needed, however you should use it only when you believe it’s appropriate. Such as, don’t use a MAN 7T when you’re just casually driving around the site.
