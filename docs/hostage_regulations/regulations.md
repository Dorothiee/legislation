### Clarifications

 - If a hostage taker breaks any of the regulations listed in this document, any combative regardless of rank or subdivision may terminate the hostage takers who are violating the regulations.
 - If a Class-D makes a request that you cannot abide by, and if they keep requesting it even after you specify that it's not allowed, you're fully allowed to engage and terminate them. 
 - Class-D cannot repeatedly ask you to do anything immature, such as dancing, and you may terminate them if that's their request. 
 - Combatives do not NEED to meet any Class-D demands, however it can be done if necessary.
 - Class-Ds who request for Free Roam, before being allowed to roam any area, must be disarmed before they conduct the free roam.
 - If a Class-D requests for a SCP said SCP must actively be on-site.

### Hostage Situation

A hostage situation is anything in which a hostile GoI or personnel has prohibited a Foundation member from actively getting to a safe place or away from a threat. If a hostage situation is to occur the Foundation members are required to state that they’ve been taken hostage in the Public Staff radio and where they’ve been taken hostage. During a hostage situation an SRU Agent or R-8 member will actively try handling the situation while ensuring the welfare of said hostages. If a hostage situation is invalid or has turned invalid all combative personnel are allowed to rush said situation, what makes a hostage situation invalid is that it has failed to abide by the regulations stated in the aforementioned sections. An example of an invalid hostage situation is as follows;

 - A Class-D personnel requesting for a Foundation staff member to do something that is prohibited by the Supreme Guidelines.
 - Finally a Chaos Insurgency Member tries to take a Foundation staff member hostage in a room with combatives present.
